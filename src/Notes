I ENTERED THE MATRIX
Patch 1.1:
	I'm starting to comment what is left to do on the program here in patch notes
	New:
	-	class notes with patch updates
	Need to be modified:
	-	user experience:
		simulator with pictures instead of numbers
		Menu for 
	Bugs:
	-	When a agent is on the goal location of another agent, the second agent can't
		find its goal and the program will crash	
	-	Agents can't cross

Patch 1.2:
	New:
	-	class UserVariables which stores informations about the coordinations of the
		agents and the obstacles.
	-	simplifying of the main class
	-	Simulation finally got pictures
	Bugs:
	-	Some Agents just looks for every other placement until it looks at the goal 
		location.
	Need to be modified:
	-	Editor to simpler place obstacles and agents
	-	or a sort of menu
	-	commenting
Patch 1.3: (13.06.2014)
	New:
	-	Adding date to patch
	Bugs:
	-	Some bug in goal-searching leading to only one agent to be at his goal
	-	Graphic bugs when height or length < 3
Patch 1.4: (16.06.2014)
	New:
	-	Graphic problem with h and l < 3 are solved
		(deepkonstant was set to 30 instead of 40, which is the same amount as the pictures width and
		100 pixels were added to width and height for edges and space between the pictures)
	-	The problem with crossing doesn't seem do be happening anymore but may be considered in new
		algorithm steps
	Need to be modified:
	-	still commenting of Agent.java and AlgrorithmAgent.java
Patch 1.5: (17.06.2014)
	New:
	-	I solved the problem with only one agent arriving at its goal before the program finished.
		Then I found out that if one agent was at his goal both would still search for a new field 
		to target which I also solved.
	-	I think the problem with agent on goals of other agents is solved due to the checkGoal() method
		in AlgorithmAgent.java
	-	fields in algorithm simulation which are on the simulation are now marked
	-	output file in local folder
	-	displaying of output file
	-	disposing of algorithm simulation at the end
	-	minor changes
	-	code consists now of 1166 lines
	Need to be modified:
	-	closeList fields need to be marked on the algorithm
	-	commenting
	-	editor or menu
Patch 1.6: (18.06.2014)
	New:
	-	more commenting
	-	minor bug changes
	-	BIG BUG with no possible crossing over is solved but made a mixing up of the code
	Bugs:
	-	The algorithm calculates g like h instead of really looking at how much fields were passed
		until getting to that place.
	-	If there is temporarly no possible path the program shuts down (solved but further tests must be done)
Patch 1.7: (21.06.2014)
	New:
	-	Class-diagram
	-	InputFileReader
	-	Editor under maintainance
Patch 1.8: (22.06.2014)
	New:
	-	Editor uncommented
	EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE COMMENTED PROPERLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	
Patch 1.9: (23.06.2014)
	New:
	-	more commenting
	-	minor fixing
	-	code consists now of 1945 lines
